view templates

All each of you are doing is to create a new template file (or as many as you like).  i.e.  The 'image' template simply uses the page Image to show that image on the screen full screen., but if someone made a  'summary.html' template, it might have the pageImage in the top left, along with a border, along with pageTitle, then things like pageDetails could be in other locations and other fonts and alignments in the layout.

Here's the latest live templates folder.  Please use this as a guide.  Note the 'history' template from Lauren was recently included.  Use that as a guide, then feel free to do what you like.  Note the folder structure for any additional CSS includes from her history template.
