view templates

All each of you are doing is to create a new template file (or as many as you like).  i.e.  The 'image' template simply uses the page Image to show that image on the screen full screen., but if someone made a  'summary.html' template, it might have the pageImage in the top left, along with a border, along with pageTitle, then things like pageDetails could be in other locations and other fonts and alignments in the layout.

Once again, if you think the pages table needs an additional field to support the content goals, let me know and we can chat it out here in the slack.

Hopefully within these 2 weeks we will have some new view templates for use in the sign software, as well as the bare-bones SSStack framework where we will be creating the CMS to manage these fields in the pages table of the mysql database.

For now just think about landing page templates that show well for full screen 1080p type landscape screens. 

For now please add any styles and JS within the single template but feel free to get creative, perhaps animation effects, good fonts and colors, etc.

Consider the VMA website -- what colors and fonts does it use ?

Remember, these are templates, that means the image, and text will be dynamic for any/many different types of content.  The idea on this first project is layout, style, and capturing what some of that content is/will be.
